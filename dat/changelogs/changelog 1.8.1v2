=== changelog 1.8.1v2 ===

* + compatible with craftbukkit 1317
* + big changes to tree detection alghorithms
** different alghorithms for oak and birch trees
** now requires that the tree grows on a dirt block
** now requires that leaves around the tree were grown naturally
* + more efficient because the last chopped tree is stored in memory
* + can chop complete trees because of the above; trees in memory do not have to meet the requirements anymore
